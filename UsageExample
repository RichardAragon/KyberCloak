Note that you need to load the KYBER public and private keys as well as the AES key and IV for both encryption and decryption. Also, note that since we are generating nonces, the initial session setup must include sending the shared secret via TCP, but it also needs to have the corresponding public key so that the receiving party can verify its authenticity. Once all parties agree to continue communication, they should perform the first encryption operation, whereby a final payload comprising the concatenated nonce, ciphertext, and digital signature is sent over the network. When receiving such a packet, the recipient uses their own copy of the public key to check whether the digital signature was validly generated by the sender. If validation fails, the receiver drops the packet; otherwise, they proceed with decrypting the ciphertext and recovering the original message. In terms of performance considerations, each call to the `Encryptor` class involves several expensive operations, including loading the private key, signing the message, constructing the final payload, and computing the hash function for the initial session setup. Therefore, depending on your application requirements, you may wish to optimize these calls or cache some of the results to improve overall system throughput. On the other hand, when running in production mode, we recommend using a high-performance hardware accelerator for faster cryptographic operations, which would allow you to scale up your infrastructure more easily without worrying about CPU bottlenecks. Ultimately, choosing the right balance between security, usability, scalability, and cost requires careful consideration of your specific business goals, risk profile, and available resources.
